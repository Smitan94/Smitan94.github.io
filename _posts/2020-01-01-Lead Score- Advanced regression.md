In this case study, we have been assigned by an education company named X Education which sells online courses to industry professionals to identify the right leads.

Background: On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses, however, there are a lot of leads generated in the initial stage, but only a few of them come out as paying customers. In the middle stage, we need to nurture the potential leads well (i.e. educating the leads about the product, constantly communicating etc. ) in order to get a higher lead conversion.

Problem Statement: To build a model wherein we need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.

Also, discuss the important variables which are behind high lead scores
