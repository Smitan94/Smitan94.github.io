excerpt: "Identifying countries in dire need of help by segmenting them on various socio-economic factors "
---
In this case study, we have been selected by HELP (an international humanitarian organisation) which is committed to fighting poverty and providing the people of backward countries with basic amenities and relief during the time of disasters and natural calamities.

Background: After the recent funding programmes, they have been able to raise around $ 10 million. Now the CEO of the NGO needs to decide how to use this money strategically and effectively. The significant issues that come while making this decision are mostly related to choosing the countries that are in the direst need of aid.

Problem Statement: We need to categorise the countries using some socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country. We will then suggest the countries which the CEO needs to focus on the most along with visualisation and reasonings.
