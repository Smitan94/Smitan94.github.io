I am a data science enthusiast who excels in machine learning and exploratory data analysis. I have an inquisitive mind and absolutely love learning new things.

I believe data science holds the key in transforming the world into a better place. Not only can data be used to achieve better results in the field of research and sciences but it can also serve as a guiding light to improve the socio economic welfare of people around the world.  Right information enables right decision making which in turn leads to right actions. From governments looking to build smart cities to farmers being less reliant on environmental factors, data science can play an important role in bringing about these transformations. And it is my wishful thinking that I am an enabler in this change.
